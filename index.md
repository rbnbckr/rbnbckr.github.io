Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) of Computer Science at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. My research interests revolve around the topics algorithms, graphs, and randomness. I hold a PhD degree from Saarland University (Germany). While being a doctoral student (2014-2018) I was a member of the Algorithms and Complexity department at Max Planck Institute for Informatics that was then headed by Prof. Kurt Mehlhorn. Thereafter, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science department of the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L'Aquila, Italy (2018-2022) until I joined Ca' Foscari University of Venice in November 2022.
