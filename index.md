Hi! I am Assistant Professor (RTD-A) in Computer Science at **Ca' Foscari University of Venice**. My research interests revolve around the topics **algorithms, graphs, and randomness**. I hold a PhD degree from Saarland University (Germany). While being a doctoral student (2014-2018) I was a member of the Algorithms and Complexity department at Max Planck Institute for Informatics that was then headed by Prof. Kurt Mehlhorn. Thereafter, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science department of the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L'Aquila, Italy (2018-2022). I then joined Ca' Foscari University of Venice in November 2022, where I am employed on the ERC starting grant project [Regindex](https://pric.unive.it/projects/regindex/home) of [Nicola Prezza](https://nicolaprezza.github.io).
